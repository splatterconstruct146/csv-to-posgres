# CSV to PosgreSQL
A python script for copying a local csv file into a posgres database.

This script takes https://youtu.be/wqBFgaMgFQA as an example/inspiration.

The main motivation for using this script is due to SQL being very useful for finding insights in a database. At the time of writing, I'm not as proficient with Python as compared to SQL.

Thus, being able to push a csv database into a PostgreSQL database is much more useful for manipulation/queries later as a next step.
